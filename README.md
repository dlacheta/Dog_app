# Dog app

This app is allowing to check random pictures of dogs provided by API. More data is provided for the website using infinity scroll. Each image can be added or removed from favorites. All the liked pictures can be seen in separate tab. Data about favorites is stored in local storage. I build this app using React, Redux,
Bootstrap and Axios.
